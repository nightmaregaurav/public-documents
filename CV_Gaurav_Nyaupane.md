*Undergraduate technical thesis, Tribhuvan University, unpublished.*  \
Designed and implemented an electronic medical record platform addressing fragmented handwritten medical records in Nepal. Focused on secure, centralized access to patient histories to support clinical decision-making and continuity of care.

**Glide: A Portable Braille Converter Using Mechanical Miniature Pistons**  \
*Conceptual design and abstract, unpublished.*  \
Proposed a handheld assistive device combining OCR-based computer vision with mechanically actuated Braille output to support real-time reading for visually impaired users.

**Family Tree: A Computerized System for Visualizing and Managing Ancestral Lineage**  \
*Undergraduate technical thesis, Tribhuvan University, unpublished.*  \
Developed a digital system to model, visualize, and manage genealogical relationships, replacing error-prone handwritten lineage records.

**ERealEstate: Online Real Estate Auction System**  \
*Undergraduate technical thesis, Tribhuvan University, unpublished.*  \
Implemented a web-based real estate auction platform with real-time bidding, focusing on transparency, accessibility, and reduced brokerage dependency.
